This folder contains the scripts of a class project to map land cover in the Chicamocha River Canyon (Colombian Andes) with the aim of a Random Forest Algorithm.

The script, named "Data download and pre-process code", was created on Google Earth Engine and it is based on Java. This script shows the steps to download, pre-process, and get the NDVI of the Chicamocha River canyon, the study area I defined. 

The second script titled "DataScienceProject_DataCollection.ipynb" shows the following:

Step 1. Mount the G-Drive

Step 2. Install and import a series of functions and modules.

Step 3. Import and convert the raster dataset into arrays.

Step 4. Preparation and definition of the predictor and predictand variables. 

Step 5. Train the random forest algorithm, fitting the model to the training data, and get the prediction score.
